1. Input files:
    There are 3 important input files for the program: "gates.txt", "lots.txt" and "parking_account.txt". "gates.txt" and "lots.txt" are for the gates and lots information given in the description, DON'T try to modify them. "parking_account.txt" is the required input file for parking machine account details.

2. Tips for users:
(1) The program can only be ended at the gate choosing menu. Once "Exit" is chosen, it will end and automatically save the final information into "parking_information.txt".
(2) There is no option "Allot a Parking place", but instead, it will automatically allot the parking place once the money paid reaches the cost.
